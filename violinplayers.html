    <h1>who is vivaldi?</h1>
    <p>
      Antonio Lucio Vivaldi[n 2] (4 March 1678 – 28 July 1741) was an Italian
      composer, virtuoso violinist and impresario of Baroque music.[4] Along
      with Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel, Vivaldi ranks
      amongst the greatest Baroque composers and his influence during his
      lifetime was widespread across Europe, giving origin to many imitators and
      admirers. He pioneered many developments in orchestration, violin
      technique and programmatic music.[5] He consolidated the emerging concerto
      form into a widely accepted and followed idiom. Vivaldi composed many
      instrumental concertos, for the violin and a variety of other musical
      instruments, as well as sacred choral works and more than fifty operas.
      His best-known work is a series of violin concertos known as The Four
      Seasons. Many of his compositions were written for the all-female music
      ensemble of the Ospedale della Pietà, a home for abandoned children.
      Vivaldi began studying for the priesthood at the age of 15 and was
      ordained at 25, but was given dispensation to no longer say public Masses
      due to a health problem.[6] Vivaldi also had some success with expensive
      stagings of his operas in Venice, Mantua and Vienna. After meeting the
      Emperor Charles VI, Vivaldi moved to Vienna, hoping for royal support.
      However, the Emperor died soon after Vivaldi's arrival, and Vivaldi
      himself died in poverty less than a year later. After almost two centuries
      of decline, Vivaldi's musical reputation underwent a revival in the early
      20th century, with much scholarly research devoted to his work. Many of
      Vivaldi's compositions, once thought lost, have been rediscovered – some
      as recently as 2015.[7] His music remains widely popular in the present
      day and is regularly played all over the world.
